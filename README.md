# RestaurantManagementSystem
A Java Edu App to prove knowledge on design patterns and best practices.




This project makes us of a basic use of Layered Architecture, being build with 3 different packages:
    1. Data Layer - Serializable and data trafer
    2. Presentation Layer - User Interface for Waiter, Admin and an Observable Order Menu for the Chef (Java Swing)
    3. Business Layer - operations - using The Composite Design Pattern in order to define a side/ composite product.

Data and preferences are saved locally in a serialized file that is going to be loaded by the app's controller.
